Tomcate Information

Your private Tomcat is setup for presphere.com. 

Your temporary preview link for your container until your domain name has fully propagated:
http://jpcloudusa018.nshostserver.net:33306

Once your domain has propagated fully, you will no longer need to use the temporary url and port.
(If no port is list above you will receive another email with the port number)

Upload files to presphere.com/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/ or you may create your own webapp in the webapps directory.
